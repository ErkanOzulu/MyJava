Collection (I): 
		
		List (I): Has Index, Allows Duplicates


		Set (I): Does not have index, does not allow duplicates

				HashSet (C): order is random

				LinkedHashSet (C): keeps the insertion order

				TreeSet (C): keeps sorted order, does not accept null


		Queue(I)

		//From Collection back to array
          String[] arr = {"Wooden Spoon", "Eggs", "Coke", "Paper towels"};
          arr = new LinkedHashSet<>( Arrays.asList(arr) ).toArray(new String[0]);

          From one type of Collection to the other one
          ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
          list = new ArrayList<>(  new LinkedHashSet<>(list)  );
